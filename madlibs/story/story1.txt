Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth name1 The adj1? I thought not.
It's not a story the group1 would tell you. It's a group2 legend.
Darth name1 was a adj2 Lord of the group2, so powerful and so wise he could use the noun1 to
influence the noun2 to create opp2… He had such a knowledge of the adj2 side that he could even keep
the ones he cared about from opp1. The adj2 side of the noun1 is a pathway to many abilities some
consider to be adj3. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his noun3,
which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his
apprentice verb1 him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from opp1, but not himself.
